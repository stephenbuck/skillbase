**Design:**

The member service implements member profiles itself, but delegates to a third-party IAM for authentication, authorization, and JWT.

**Domain Entities:**

* MemberGroup
* MemberUser

**Domain Events:**

* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_GROUP_CREATED
* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_GROUP_DELETED
* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_GROUP_UPDATED
* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_USER_CREATED
* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_USER_DELETED
* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_USER_UPDATED

See Backend / Design for common design elements.
