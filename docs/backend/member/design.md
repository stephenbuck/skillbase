**Design:**

The member service is responsible for managing users, groups, and achievements.
Users represent member profiles. Users can be members of Groups. Achievements
are associated with a user.

The member service delegates some of its functionality to a third-party IAM
(e.g. Keycloak) for authentication, authorization, and JWT tokens.


**Domain Entities:**

* MemberAchievement
* MemberGroup
* MemberProcess
* MemberUser

**Domain Events:**

* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_ACHIEVEMENT_CREATED
* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_ACHIEVEMENT_DELETED
* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_ACHIEVEMENT_UPDATED

* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_GROUP_CREATED

* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_GROUP_UPDATED

* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_PROCESS_CREATED
* SKILLBASE_MEMBER_PROCESS_DELETED
