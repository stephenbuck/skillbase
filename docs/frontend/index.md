**Overview:**

I’ve done heaps of frontend development work in the past, but I’m more focused on backend development these days, so I’m going to go with some popular choices.

**Framework (React)**

The primary frontend framework is React, with the code written in Typescript. I'll be using other frameworks ReactRouter, ReactRelay, ReactAdmin, MaterialUI and NextJS.

**Interfaces (GraphQL, REST)**

The backend will support GraphQL and REST so the client will have to follow along. I’ll be using the Relay client library since it’s designed for the React framework.
