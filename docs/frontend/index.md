Overview:

I’ve done heaps of frontend development work in the past, but I’m more focused on backend development these days, so I’m going to go with some popular choices.

Framework (React)

I’ve worked with a lot of JavaScript frameworks like Angular, JQuery and Backbone, but React seems to be the framework du jour, so I’ll go with it. The React Router package seems like it will be useful for a Single-Page Architecture, which is my current bias, due to the high likelihood for customization and integration.

Interfacing (GraphQL, REST)

The backend will support GraphQL and REST so the client will have to follow along. I’ll be using the Relay client library since it’s designed for the React framework.
