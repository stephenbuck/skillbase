*** Work in Progress ***

**Overview:**

SkillBase is a showcase distributed application that allows an organization to develop, certify, and track the skill sets of its members. Organizations like schools, employers, or the military. The primary elements of the application are users, skills, and certifications. Users select skills and then follow a workflow to be granted certification. There is lots of room for integration with third-party applications for identity management, content management, social media, etc.
