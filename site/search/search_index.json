Organizations like schools, employers, or the military. The primary elements of the application are users, skills, and certifications. Users select skills and then follow a workflow to be granted certification. There is lots of room for integration with third-party applications for identity management, content management, social media, etc. A primary goal of this application is to illustrate the use of the most popular tools in use today. Some of the tools used: Modern Java (version 21+) Microservices (Jakarta EE, DDD) Runtime (Wildfly, Spring Boot) Event-Driven (JMS, Kafka, Cloud Events) Feature Flags (Open Features, Flipt) Security (JWT, OAuth, Keycloak) Database (JPA, Postgres, Liquibase) Containers (Docker) Infrastructure (Terraform, Kubernetes) Configuration (Microprofile, etcd) Workflow (BPMN, Flowable) Search (Elasticsearch) Caching (Redis) Interfaces (REST, GraphQL) Logging (Log4j, Slf4j, fluentd) Testing (JUnit, ArchUnit, Testcontainers) Build (Maven and NPM) Monitoring (Microprofile, Prometheus) Frontend (Typescript, SPA, React, MaterialUI) Documentation (Markdown, OpenAPI, MkDocs) Versioning (Git) Modern Java The Skillbase backend is written using modern Java (version 21+). Microservices Designed as a set of microservices, according to the Jakarta EE 10 specifications. Runtime Runs as a set of Docker containers, one-per-service, combined with Wildfly and Spring Boot. Event-Driven Event-driven design allows for maximum scalability, flexibility, and integration with other products. Code is written to the Jakarta JMS specification using Kafka as the message broker. Feature Flags Built-in support for feature-flags using OpenFeatures with a Flipt provider. Security Integrated with IAM provider, Keycloak, for JWT, OAuth, and RBAC security. Database Built on industry-standard Postgres relational database, using the Jakarta JPA framework and the Liquibase schema management tool. Future versions may use MongoDB for account profiles. Containers All services and providers are deployed as Docker containers for local and cloud use. Infrastructure Infrastructure is built using Terraform code and managed using Kubernetes. Configuration Runtime application configuration is built on the Microprofile Config API running with Etcd as the provider. Workflow Workflow process management is handled using BPMN process diagrams and the Flowable engine and API. Future versions may embed the engine with the application to simplify transaction management. Search Keyword search for skills, etc. is handled by the Elasticsearch engine. Caching Distributed caching is handled using Redis, and it's Java API. Cache contents will be updated by domain events received from Kafka. Interfaces Application access is through REST and GraphQL endpoints. Logging Logging is handled with Log4j and Slf4j. Log streams across services are aggregated using Fluentd. Testing Unit testing is performed using JUnit tests. Architectural testing is performed using ArchUnit. Integration testing is performed using Testcontainers. Build The Skillbase backend is built using Maven and a variety of plugins. The frontend is built using NPM. Monitoring Monitoring is handled by a combination of Microprofile APIs and the open-source Prometheus tool. Frontend The primary frontend framework is React, with the code written in Typescript. I'll be using other frameworks ReactRouter, ReactQuery, ReactAdmin, NextJS, and MaterialUI. Documentation Documentation of the application is built using Markdown documents, automatic API documentation using OpenAPI, and the open-source MkDocs tool. Versioning Source code versioning and control is done with Git.

I\u2019m particularly interested in the intersection between DDD, microservices, and GraphQL. I\u2019m going to use a GraphQL schema, in a schema-first approach, to represent the domain model and it should serve as a \u201csingle source of truth\u201d from which other artifacts, such as SQL schemas and Java objects, can be created. Some parts of the system will be built with a code-first approach to take advantage of some of the GraphQL tools. See https://dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-domain-driven Event-Driven Architecture: An event-driven architecture is such a natural way of looking at applications that it\u2019s hard to choose any other architecture. I\u2019ve been doing some form of event-driven development for most of my career, so it\u2019s gratifying to see it being so widely used these days. I\u2019ll be using Kafka for the message broker and Cloud-Events for the event definitions. The initial version will not use event-sourcing, but future versions will use Debezium for eventual consistency among the various distributed components (microservices, distributed caches, etc). See https://apache.kafka.org See https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-clients/java/current/overview.html See https://cloudevents.io See https://github.com/enriquemolinari/jqueue See https://github.com/gruelbox/transaction-outbox Microservice Implementation: Past iterations have been implemented using a handful of services combined into one monolithic application, but there are definitely advantages to having a more fine-grained, microservice architecture and most new systems are being built this way. I\u2019ll be using a combination of Jakarta EE and Spring Boot as they are the most popular microservice frameworks for Java. Some of the microservices will delegate a portion of their functionality to backend providers (e.g. KeyCloak for IAM). See https://microprofile.io/ See https://smallrye.io See https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot Language (Java 21): I\u2019ve used Java for every backend implementation of this project so far and will use it for this one as well, especially given the recent evolution of Java, with new features like closures, records, etc. See https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/index.html Framework (Jakarta EE and Spring Boot): Jakarta EE is the latest incarnation of the J2EE framework. I have extensive experience with J2EE so it will be interesting to see how the framework has advanced. I expect to use Jakarta EE, especially the MicroProfile and its extensions, for the core framework. I'll be using Spring Boot for the runtime container for the microservices.
