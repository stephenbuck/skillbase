I\u2019m particularly interested in the intersection between DDD, microservices, and GraphQL. I\u2019m going to use a GraphQL schema, in a schema-first approach, to represent the domain model and it should serve as a \u201csingle source of truth\u201d from which other artifacts, such as SQL schemas and Java objects, can be created. Some parts of the system will be built with a code-first approach to take advantage of some of the GraphQL tools. See https://dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-domain-driven Event-Driven Architecture: An event-driven architecture is such a natural way of looking at applications that it\u2019s hard to choose any other architecture. I\u2019ve been doing some form of event-driven development for most of my career, so it\u2019s gratifying to see it being so widely used these days. I\u2019ll be using Kafka for the message broker and Cloud-Events for the event definitions. The initial version will not use event-sourcing, but future versions will use Debezium for eventual consistency among the various distributed components (microservices, distributed caches, etc). See https://apache.kafka.org See https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-clients/java/current/overview.html See https://cloudevents.io See https://github.com/enriquemolinari/jqueue See https://github.com/gruelbox/transaction-outbox Microservice Implementation: Past iterations have been implemented using a handful of services combined into one monolithic application, but there are definitely advantages to having a more fine-grained, microservice architecture and most new systems are being built this way. I\u2019ll be using a combination of Jakarta EE and Spring Boot as they are the most popular microservice frameworks for Java. Some of the microservices will delegate a portion of their functionality to backend providers (e.g. KeyCloak for IAM). See https://microprofile.io/ See https://smallrye.io Language (Java 21): I\u2019ve used Java for every backend implementation of this project so far and will use it for this one as well, especially given the recent evolution of Java, with new features like closures, records, etc. See https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/index.html Framework (Jakarta EE): Jakarta EE is the latest incarnation of the J2EE framework. I have extensive experience with J2EE so it will be interesting to see how the framework has advanced. I expect to use Jakarta EE, especially the MicroProfile and its extensions, for the core framework.

Each component of the backend is packaged into a custom Docker image derived from a standard image. For example, the 'skillbase/postgres' image is derived from the standard 'postgres' image, but adds configuration information, etc. Containers (Docker): Containers are here to stay, and Docker is the gold standard. Having a good pipeline from the build system to a Docker system will help with making the application available in the \u201ccloud\u201d and when used with an orchestration system like Kubernetes, should help enormously with scaling the system up. There aren\u2019t any alternatives that are as popular and flexible as Docker, so this is a keeper. See https://docker.com Infrastructure (Terraform and Kubernetes): Terraform is an awesome \"infrastructure as code\" tool. I'm currently using it during development to populate my Docker instance with my containers. It will be a good segue into Kubernetes in future phases. See https://kubernetes.io See https://terraform.io Database (skillbase/postgres): Database functionality (Postgres) runs in a custom container derived from the 'postges:latest' image. The Skillbase image adds SQL DDL to create the main 'skillbase' database. The individual services create their own schema and tables within the main database. The use of seperate schemas will facilitate moving to a database-per-service model in the future. See https://postgresql.org Identity (skillbase/keycloak): Identity functionaliy (Keycloak) runs in a custom container derived from the 'quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:latest' image. The Skillbase image adds custom configuration. Keycloak provides standard IAM features like authentication, OAuth suport, JWT token generation, etc. Administration is through a browser interface. Integration with the 'member' service is through a REST API. See https://www.keycloak.org Messaging (skillbase/kafka): Messaging functionality (Kafka) runs in a custom container derived from the 'bitnami/kafka:latest' image. The Skillbase image adds custom configuration and topics. Integration with the individual services is through the Kafka JMS provider. See https://kafka.apache.org Runtime (skillbase/wildfly): Runtime functionality (Wildfly) runs in a custom container derived from the 'quay.io/wildfly/wildfly:latest' image. The Skillbase image adds custom configuration for JDBC drivers, etc. In the first phase, the individual services all share a single Wildfly instance. In future phases, each service will have it's own runtime, base on Wildfly or Spring Boot. See https://www.wildfly.org See https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/maven-plugin Workflow (skillbase/flowable): Workflow functionality (Flowable) runs in a custom container derived from the 'flowable/flowable-rest:latest' image. The Skillbase image adds configuration for the database connection, etc. Flowable is the workflow engine used by the Workflow service. It executes workflow processes defined by BPMN diagrams. See https://www.flowable.org Features (skillbase/flipt): Feature flag functionality (Flipt) runs in a custom container derived from the 'docker.flipt.io/flipt/flipt:latest' image. The Skillbase image adds custom configuration. Feature flags are defined using the Flipt browser interface and then propagated to the individual services using a REST API. See https://flipt.io Caching (skillbase/redis): Caching functionality (Redis) runs in a custom container derived from the 'redis:latest' image. The Skillbase image adds custom configuration. Redis is used primarily for session management. See https://redis.io Change-Data (skillbase/debezium): Change-Data Capture functionality (Debezium) runs in a custom container derived from the 'debezium/server:latest' image.
