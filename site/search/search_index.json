Organizations like schools, employers, or the military. The primary elements of the application are users, skills, and certifications. Users select skills and then follow a workflow to be granted certification. Users can search for other users that have specific skills. There is lots of room for integration with third-party applications for member management, content management, social media, etc.","title":"Home"},{"location":"backend/","text":"Overview:","title":"Overview"},{"location":"backend/build/","text":"Build: The Skillbase backend is built using Maven and a variety of plugins for dependency management, packaging, source formatting, etc. The Docker container names are: 'skillbase/catalog:latest' 'skillbase/workflow:latest' 'skillbase/member:latest' Commands: Type 'mvn clean' to clean Type 'mvn verify' to build Type 'mvn test' to test Type 'mvn wildfly:deploy' to deploy Tools: Type 'psql -d skillbase -U postgres -h localhost -p 15432' for PostgreSQL tool (password is 'postgres')Type 'sudo mvn liquibase:help' for Liquibase tool Type 'sudo mvn docker:help' for Docker tool Type 'sudo mvn wildfly:help' for Wildfly tool Change-Data Capture (Debezium) See http://debezium.io Database Changes (Liquibase) I\u2019ve used Liquibase for SQL database change management in a number of projects and really like its flexibility.

I\u2019m particularly interested in the intersection between DDD, microservices, and GraphQL. I\u2019m going to use a GraphQL schema, in a schema-first approach, to represent the domain model and it should serve as a \u201csingle source of truth\u201d from which other artifacts, such as SQL schemas and Java objects, can be created. Some parts of the system will be built with a code-first approach to take advantage of some of the GraphQL tools. Event-Driven Architecture: An event-driven architecture is such a natural way of looking at applications that it\u2019s hard to choose any other architecture. I\u2019ve been doing some form of event-driven development for most of my career, so it\u2019s gratifying to see it being so widely used these days. I\u2019ll be using Kafka for the message broker and Cloud-Events for the event definitions. The initial version will not use event-sourcing, but future versions will use Debezium for eventual consistency among the various distributed components (microservices, distributed caches, etc). Microservice Implementation: Past iterations have been implemented using a handful of services combined into one monolithic application, but there are definitely advantages to having a more fine-grained, microservice architecture and most new systems are being built this way. I\u2019ll be using a combination of Jakarta EE and Spring Boot as they are the most popular microservice frameworks for Java. Some of the microservices will delegate a portion of their functionality to backend providers (e.g. KeyCloak for IAM). Language (Java 21): I\u2019ve used Java for every backend implementation of this project so far and will use it for this one as well, especially given the recent evolution of Java, with new features like closures, records, etc. Framework (Jakarta EE): Jakarta EE is the latest incarnation of the J2EE framework. I have extensive experience with J2EE so it will be interesting to see how the framework has advanced. I expect to use Jakarta EE, especially the MicroProfile and its extensions, for the core framework. Authentication / Authorization (Jakarta EE JWT): The Skillbase backend uses the Jakarta EE JWT framework for runtime authentication and authorization. Configuration (Jakarta EE Configuration): The Skillbase backend uses the Jakarta EE Config framework for runtime configuration. Fault-Tolerance (Jakarta EE Fault-Tolerance): The Skillbase backend uses the Jakarta EE Fault-Tolerance framework to implement fault-tolerance. Feature Flags (OpenFeatures): The Skillbase backend uses the OpenFeatures framework to manage feature flags. GraphQL (Jakarta Microprofile GraphQL): The Skillbase backend uses the Jakarta Microprofile GraphQL framework to provide GraphQL endpoints. Health (Jakarta EE Health): Sklllbase uses the Jakarta EE Health framework to runtime health information. Messaging (Jakarta EE JMS): The Skillbase backend uses the Jakarta EE JMS framework to produce and consume events. Metrics (Jakarta EE Metrics): The Skillbase backend uses the Jakarta EE Metrics framework to provide runtime metrics. Persistence (Jakarta EE Persistence): The Skillbase backend uses the Jakara EE Persistence framework for object storage. REST (Jakarta EE JAX-RS): The Skillbase backend uses the Jakarta EE JAX-RS framework to provide REST endpoints. Telemetry (Jakarta EE Telemetry): The Skillbase backend uses the Jakarta EE Telemetry framework to provide runtime telemetry. Logging (Log4j, Slf4j): The Skillbase backend uses the Log4j and Slf4j libraries to generate logs.
